Redux Mod

This mod focuses on being an abstraction layer on top of Forge/FML allowing content that can be created via MC 1.8 assets and a config file.  All content created via this mod will be limited to the framework provided, which will focus on simple in-world interaction mechanics.

Currently the mod is not even in an alpha state.  The exact list of future features is to be determined at this time.
